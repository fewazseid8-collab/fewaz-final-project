# Frontend environment variables (Create React App - build-time)
# Place this in `frontend/.env` for local development, and set the same key in Render (Static Site) environment variables before building.

# API base url used by the frontend (include /api if your backend serves API under /api)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4321/api

# Example for production after backend is deployed:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com/api
